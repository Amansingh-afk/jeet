If price increases by X% and consumption decreases by Y%, find net change in expenditure. Given price change and expenditure change, find consumption change.",

      "explanation": "**Core Concept: Expenditure = Price × Quantity**\n\nJab price aur consumption dono change hote hain, toh expenditure ka net effect nikalna hai.\n\n**Method: Use Multipliers**\n\n1. Convert % to multiplier:\n   - +X% → multiply by (1 + X/100)\n   - -X% → multiply by (1 - X/100)\n\n2. Apply the relationship:\n   Exp_new/Exp_old = (P_new/P_old) × (C_new/C_old)\n   \n3. Solve for unknown:\n   - Given P% and C%, find E%: E = P × C\n   - Given P% and E%, find C%: C = E / P\n   - Given C% and E%, find P%: P = E / C\n\n**Example 1: Find Expenditure Change**\nPrice +20%, Consumption -20%\nE = 1.20 × 0.80 = 0.96 → -4% expenditure\n\n**Example 2: Find Consumption Change**\nPrice +23%, Expenditure +5%\nC = 1.05 / 1.23 = 0.854 → -14.6% consumption",
