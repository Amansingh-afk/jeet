      "explanation": "**Core Concept: Chain Percentage Relationships**\n\nJab multiple values/incomes percentage relationships mein diye hon, toh:\n\n**Step 1: Find the anchor**\nWoh value dhundho jisse zyada references hain. Usually middle value best anchor hai.\n\n**Step 2: Assume anchor = 100**\nIsse calculations easy ho jaate hain.\n\n**Step 3: Chain calculate**\n- 'A is X% of B' → A = B × X/100\n- 'A is X% more than B' → A = B × (100+X)/100\n- 'A is X% less than B' → A = B × (100-X)/100\n- 'B is X% more than A' → A = B / (1 + X/100)\n\n**Step 4: Compare as asked**\n- '% more than' → (Diff/Smaller) × 100\n- '% less than' → (Diff/Bigger) × 100\n\n**Example:**\nA = 40% of B, B is 24% more than C, find C is how much % more than A?\n\nB = 100 (anchor)\nA = 40% of 100 = 40\nC = 100/1.24 = 80.65\n\nC more than A by = (80.65 - 40)/40 × 100 = 101.6%",

Compare: (Diff/Base) × 100\n\n**Example:** B=100, A=40, C=80.65\nC more than A = 40.65/40 × 100 = 101.6%",
